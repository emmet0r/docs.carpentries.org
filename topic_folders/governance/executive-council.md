### Board of Directors Standing Committees
Each Board member is expected to serve on at least one, but no more than two standing committees. Serving on a specific standing committee allows Board members to bring their subject matter expertise to specific governance and operational priorities, deal with issues and projects more effectively and efficiently, and maximise time and resources between meetings. The current standing committees are described below.

**Audit Committee**
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility concerning (1) risk management and the adequacy of insurance coverage, (2) the financial reporting process, (3) the system of internal controls, (4) the audit process, and (5) the Organisation’s process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations. The Committee appoints and manages an external (independent) auditor.

**Finance Committee**
The Finance Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility concerning the annual budget.

**Governance & Personnel Committee**
The Governance and Personnel Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by creating and implementing sound compensation and personnel policies and practices and ongoing oversight of the Executive Director and Board efficacy, composition, onboarding, and recruitment. 

**Program Committee**
The Program Committee approves and monitors The Carpentries programs and services.
