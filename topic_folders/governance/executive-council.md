### Executive Council Officers

Executive Council officers are selected at the first regular meeting following election and appointment of new members and serve one year terms. Officer positions include:

* Chair
* Vice Chair
* Secretary
* Treasurer

Roles and responsibilities for Executive Council Officers are described in the [bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#officers).

### Executive Council Standing Committees
As of January 2021, the following standing committee structure was implemented as a practical way to manage the work and engagement of the Executive Council:

- [Officers Committee](#officers-committee)
- [Governance Committee](#governance-committee)
- [Finance Committee](#finance-committee)
- [Program Committee](#program-committee)

Serving on a specific standing committee provides Executive Council members with the opportunity to bring their subject matter expertise to specific governance and operational priorities, deal with issues and projects more effectively and efficiently, and maximize time and resources between meetings. Each Executive Council member serves on at least one, but no more than two committees. When considered beneficial or necessary, these committees can have members from The Carpentries community and/or Core Team.

In addition to the Standing committees, the Executive Council may appoint ad hoc committees to handle issues that are typically short-term and specialised in nature.
