##### Initial Member Contact Email (Online Training)

SUBJECT: Carpentries Instructor Training for [ site_name ]

Hi [ site contact name ],

Congratulations on your institution’s 
[ new membership with The Carpentries / Carpentries membership renewal ]. 
As a [silver/gold/platinum] member, you have a total of [ number ] 
seats in Instructor Training available to you. We would like to get you
set up for Instructor Training early in your membership year so that
your new Instructors can productively build a Carpentries community 
at your institution. 

We run two-day, online Instructor Training workshops multiple times 
per month. These events are scheduled for a range of time zones, to 
better serve our global community. We recommend, if possible, that 
your trainees join the same training event and are co-localised. 
This enables them to know each other over the course of the event 
and build up your local community.  We recognise that it can be 
difficult to coordinate everyone’s schedules, however, so we do 
provide the flexibility of trainees joining different events. If 
your trainees are not able to attend an event together as a team,
we recommend that you host a social event for your trainees (and 
others in your community) to get together. 

To register, please direct your team members to our Instructor
Training workshop registration page
(https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html). 
Your trainees should register with the code: [ insert code here in bold ]. 
This code can be used [ number ] times. Please be sure to share this
code with your trainees. They should also fill out our application form
( https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/ )
using the same code. For guidance about how to select your 
trainees, please visit our Information for Member Organisations page
at https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/members/. 

You can use this email template (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/email_templates_admin.html#initial-trainee-contact-email-from-member-site-to-their-prospective-trainees-online-training) to send this information to 
your group. If one of your affiliates is not able to attend after 
they've registered for an event, please get in touch with us at 
team@carpentries.org as soon as possible. In some cases, we will be 
able to transfer your training seat to another event. However, 
because the success of our program depends on accurately predicting 
our capacity needs, we may not be able to accommodate changes in 
registration unless we are notified at least one week in advance of the event.

 Note that in order to provide the best experience for our trainees, 
 in rare instances events may be canceled due to low enrolment.  If 
 this happens, your trainees will be notified two weeks before the event and will 
 have the opportunity to sign up for a future event.

For more information about our Instructor Training program, including 
details about our curriculum, certification process, and logistical 
details of the training event itself, please visit our Information 
for Member Organisations page at 
https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/members/. 

I’m excited to help you build your team of Carpentries instructors at 
[ site_name ]. Please let me know once you’ve shared this 
registration information with your trainees so we know that your team
is ready to come on board. Feel free to  get in touch if you have any 
questions about this process, including checking on the status of 
your remaining seats. 

Best,

##### Decline Open Training Applications

Subject: The Carpentries Open Instructor Training Application

Hello,

Thank you for applying to The Carpentries Open Instructor Training program. This program provides training to individual applicants who do not otherwise have access to Instructor Training (e.g. through an institutional membership). If you did not intend to apply to this program, you may disregard this email.

This email is being sent to let you know that your application has received a low score and will not be accepted into the program. Low scores usually occur when an application does not meet any of our current [growth priorities](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/rubric.md), and additionally can result from blank or insufficiently detailed free text responses, or answers that reflect a lack of clarity about the purpose of the training or The Carpentries’ mission. 

If you feel that you are a good fit to support the mission of The Carpentries and would like to be reconsidered for this program, we welcome you to [reapply](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/). In your application, be sure to provide detailed responses to the free text questions explaining your passion for becoming part of The Carpentries Instructor team. You may also want to read more about [our mission](https://carpentries.org/about/) and our [Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) program before reapplying.

Note that if you have filed multiple applications with us, this message only applies to one of them -- if you might have an application on file with a higher score, you are welcome to inquire by replying to this email. **The application that triggered this message will now be archived**, so you will not be contacted again with respect to the same application.

We do our best to offer training for all, but we regret that there is a limit to the number of free seats we are able to offer for Instructor Training at this time. If you have questions about how to strengthen your application, please get in touch! 

Best,

[Sender name]

##### One Week Trainee Email (online training)

SUBJECT: Information for your upcoming Instructor Training with The Carpentries

Hello everyone,

Thank you for registering for The Carpentries Instructor Training workshop on [ DATE-TIME-TIMEZONE ]. This email contains important information to help you prepare for the training - please read it carefully and let me know if you have any questions.

This training is for people who want to become certified Carpentries instructors. This workshop will introduce you to evidence-based best-practices of teaching. We will teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops, provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills, help you become integrated into the Carpentries community, and prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentries workshops. For more information about what will be covered at this training, check out our Instructor Training curriculum: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/.

This is training for teaching, not technical training. We recommend that you be familiar with at least one of the technologies that we teach (R, Python, the Unix bash shell, SQL, OpenRefine, spreadsheet software, and/or Git) before taking Instructor Training. We will not be covering the contents of our workshop curricula during Instructor Training, but we do provide optional post-training onboarding sessions and mentoring opportunities to help prepare Instructors to teach particular curricula.

Our instructor Trainers [ trainer1 ] and [ trainer2 ] will be leading your training. This online training will be conducted using the Zoom video conferencing platform.  No log in is needed, but you may need to install a browser extension. To access the training please use this link: [INSERT LINK]. All participants are required to have their own laptop and earbuds/headphones. Screen sharing is necessary for some activities, and display of video as much as possible throughout the workshop is recommended for the best experience. Some participants may be attending the training in the same room. If this is the case, please be sure that everyone is wearing their earbuds/headphones and are muted at all times when not speaking. Your Trainers have put together a workshop website with information about the schedule: [INSERT LINK]

Attendance is required for the full two-days of the workshop in order to certify as a Carpentries Instructor.  Participants who miss more than one hour will not pass our training requirements. If you know ahead of time that you will miss an hour of the training, please notify your Trainers.

Before your training, please:

 - Complete our pre-workshop survey [INSERT LINK] . Your responses will help your Trainers understand your background and customize the workshop appropriately.
 - Read this short paper: https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/files/papers/science-of-learning-2015.pdf which provides a brief overview of some key evidence-based results in teaching.
 - Go to the Software Carpentry lessons page (http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), the Data Carpentry lessons page (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or the Library Carpentry lessons page (https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) to see what we currently teach. Carefully read through one episode of your choice. You will be using your selected episode for several in-class exercises, so be sure you are comfortable with the content. Note: an episode is not the entire lesson, but a single page of the lesson.

After your training, you will be asked to do three follow-up exercises online in order to become a certified Instructor. These requirements are detailed at https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/ and will be discussed at your training. If you have any questions about the workshop, the reading material, or anything else, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

Happy Training - we are excited to have you on board!

##### Follow-up - Trainers Attendance List (option 1)

Hi [INSERT TRAINERS NAMES], 

Thank you for taking time to teach The Carpentries Instructor Training on [INSERT DATES]! I hope you had a great experience. I am following up with you to obtain the attendance from the training. 

For your convenience, I have included the names of trainees in this [INSERT FILE]. Please indicate the attendance for both days so that I can record their progress and get them on track to becoming certified Carpentries instructors! 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi [TRAINER NAMES], 

Thanks again for teaching The Carpentries Instructor Training on

##### Zoom test invitation to Host Site

Hi [Host Name],

Thank you for hosting a Carpentries Instructor Training on 
[ date/time including time zone]. We will be using the Zoom 
videoconferencing platform for this event.  To ensure that the 
training runs smoothly, I’d like to set up a Zoom test run with you 
prior to the event. This should not take much time, however, it is 
important that this happens to detect any problems and have time to 
troubleshoot them prior to the training. We all want to stick to the
schedule, and want to avoid spending time troubleshooting on the 
morning of the event.

A few things to consider when conducting the test:
* Be in the room that the training will take place in. 
* Have access to the audio system that will be used
* Have access to the projector that will be used

We will make sure that we can see and hear each other, and that I can
see all the seats people will be in for the event itself.

To schedule a test run, you can [ email me/look at my calendar ]. 
Please let me know if you cannot find a time that works, so we can 
look for some other options.

I am looking forward to having your team on board! Please let me know
if you have any questions about how this works.

Best, 
[ sender name ]

Hi [ trainee name ],

Thank you for completing your checkout. I've updated your status in our database and you are now officially certified as a Carpentries

Please note that although your certificate reads either Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry you are fully certified to teach all workshops for The Carpentries.

If you have not already, please be sure to join the instructors mailing list (https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors). This

Your status as a newly certified Instructor also makes you eligible to vote for The Carpentries' Executive Council.

##### Recruiting New Trainers

Subject: Opportunity to join The Carpentries Trainers community

Hi [ name ],

I wanted to get in touch with you about an opportunity to get involved with The Carpentries community. Software Carpentry (SWC), Library Carpentry (LC), and Data Carpentry (DC) are lesson programs of The Carpentries (a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives). We are focused on spreading computational literacy to researchers around the world. We run intensive, hands-on, two-day workshops to help researchers and other professionals develop the fundamental computational skills they need to do their research. Together, we run over 300 workshops a year, and have reached more than 25,000 learners in 30 countries.

Our workshops are taught by volunteers who go through a two-day training program focused on pedagogy and cognitive psychology. These training events are run by our Instructor Trainers who also help to develop and maintain our instructor training curriculum. 

The Carpentries Trainers are an eclectic group. Some of us have formal training in pedagogy, some are experienced Carpentries instructors, others run Carpentries-like trainings as part of their jobs. We all share a commitment to helping new instructors become familiar and comfortable with The Carpentries teaching practices and principles.

If you’re interested in joining the Trainer community, please apply here (https://goo.gl/forms/yTx9yJzdWy6OAPtS2)! Applications for this round will be open until [application_deadline]. 

If you have any questions about the training process or the expectations for being a Trainer, please contact team@carpentries.org

To learn more about what we teach, check out our lessons here: (https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), here: (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/), and here: (https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/).
More detailed information about what Trainers do can be found here: (https://github.com/carpentries/policies/blob/master/trainer-agreement.md#).

Looking forward to seeing an application from you!

##### Accepting New Trainers

Subject: Congratulations! Join The Carpentries Trainer Community

Hi all,

Thank you all for applying to become instructor Trainers with The Carpentries. A group of Trainers have reviewed the applications and we're excited to invite each of you to the Trainer team.

We'll be starting our new cohort of instructor Trainers in [ month ]. Our cohort will be [ number ] folks located in [ countries ]. We'll be meeting once a week starting in [ month ] to discuss our text and how it relates to our instructor training curriculum. More details can be found in the preliminary reading schedule.

If you're interested in being part of this cohort, please try to complete the following by [ deadline ] so that we can finalise the schedule and start our meetings!

1) Please fill out this poll [ link ] for scheduling book club meetings. Do not forget to adjust the timezone shown (pull down menu above the time list). Please choose the days and times that work for you for the entire 8 week period of our book club. To complete certification as a Trainer, we'll ask that you miss at most one of our 8 book club meetings. Since we are spread across several time zones, please be as accommodating as possible in filling out your availability. We will have two meeting times per week to accommodate all time zones, but you will only need to attend one of the weekly meetings.

2) Please take a look over the process for trainer training and make sure that all of the requirements of becoming a Trainer work with your schedule and other responsibilities. We're excited to have you in the Trainer community, but do want to make sure that all Trainers are able to commit the time required, so that we are able to realistically determine the number of instructors we train per year.

3) Please get a copy of our text [ link ]. I'll send out reading assignments and discussion guides in a later email. 

4) Please also fill out your availability for instructor training events for [ month through month ] and add your name to the Trainers list in the second tab. This cohort of Trainers will be ready to co-teach instructor training events by the end of [ month ] and to teach on their own shortly after that.

5) Please add upcoming Trainer meetings (http://pad.software-carpentry.org/trainers-backup) to your calendar. These are also on the Community Calendar. Each of these is held in two different time zones - you do not need to attend both meetings, but you're welcome to!

6) Please sign up for the Trainers email list (https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/trainers) if you have not already done so.

7) Please respond to this email with a quick introduction so that we can all get to know each other. I'll send out my introduction as a separate email following this.

I know that's a lot! Let me know if you have any questions. I am looking forward to seeing you all at our first book club discussion.

Best,
[ name ]

##### Trainers' reminder: Teaching Demos

Hi! 

You’re signed up to host a Carpentries teaching demo within the next two weeks! 

Please double check your time/date link on the [etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/teaching-demos) and confirm this one-hour time slot in your calendar. 

If you know in advance that you will have a conflict and are unable to host your demo, please email the Trainers list request a replacement. In most cases staff will fill in as needed if a replacement isn’t found.

If you have a last-minute conflict, it is best to use Slack as well as email to request a replacement, and tag both me and [name]in your request on Slack. If you are unable to get help in time, please contact your trainees to cancel or reschedule.

Instructions for hosting demos are [here](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/trainers_guide.html#running-a-teaching-demonstration). Since we often have last-minute cancellations, if you have trainees contacting you to request an extra spot we suggest giving them permission to come, noting that they may not be able to present if everyone shows up. However, you are also very free to say ‘no.’ At the present time we are not able to track no-shows or cancellations for checkout, so it’s only necessary to mention those who attended in your email to instructor.training@carpentries.org after the demo.

Please get in touch with questions, and enjoy your demo session!

Best,
