## For Current Carpentries Instructors

### Professional Development for Instructors
As part of welcoming and orienting new Instructors to our community, and enriching and
building skills and community among continuing Instructors, we have a number of ways to support you.

### Instructor Training Bonus Modules
We are not currently offering Bonus Modules. However the curriculum is available for community reference. 

#### Online Teaching Bonus Module 

The [Online Teaching Bonus Module](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training-bonus-modules/index.html) is a 3.5 hour training designed to help Certified Instructors build skill and confidence while learning how to transition Instructor Training pedagogy to the online environment. During the training, you will have an opportunity to:  

- Use Zoom host and co-host features to create breakouts, screen share, manage muting and more.
- Create and discuss plans to engage with learners during a workshop.
- Write and rehearse an introduction to the logistics of your workshop that prioritizes creating on optimal learner experience and reducing barriers to participation.
- Propose communications strategies for your instructional team.


### Mentoring and Development
The [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html)
(formerly known as the Mentoring Subcommittee) manages the mentoring program, which supports Instructors as they progress
through training, teaching, curriculum development, and other community-related activities.

### Community Discussions
These hour-long sessions are organised by
the [Instructor Development Committee](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_development/instructor_development_committee.html) and
serve a number of purposes. Trainee Instructors use them as part of their checkout process. There they can raise questions about teaching workshops and other matters and get advice from more experienced Instructors. All sessions are run by volunteers. Instructors preparing to teach can attend to ask questions, get tips, and find useful examples or analogies they can use. Instructors who have recently taught can attend to debrief about what went well, and what might have gone better, so they can plan for next time. Sessions are coordinated through this [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).


### Carpentries Champions
If you are interested in building a local community, then consider joining
the [Carpentries Champions](https://pad.carpentries.org/champions). Champions calls
are run quarterly and you can hear from more experienced community members about what strategies
you can try to build grassroots communities. There is already
a [Carpentries Community Cookbook](https://cookbook.carpentries.org/), with
‘recipes’ you can adapt for your local needs. There is a
[Champions mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/champions), and
you can also join the `#champions` channel on [Slack](https://slack-invite.carpentries.org/).

### Meetups page
If you are attending a conference or event and would like to network with other Carpentries community members,
please add the details of the event and your own details to our [meetups Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/swc-events-meetup).

### Accessing and Updating Your Instructor Profile

AMY is a database application, tracking programmatic activity for The Carpentries, named for the person who was manually handling this data in the early days of Software Carpentry.  The Carpentries maintains a record of information for all individuals with roles in The Carpentries such as Instructor, Trainer, Maintainer, member site contact, and more. Most functionality is limited to authorized administrative users. Individuals whose data is tracked in AMY can view only their own profile page.

If you are unable to login to AMY, please submit your GitHub username to [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) so we can update your access.
